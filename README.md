# K2_Project

These files were written to analyse and preprocess data from a Van Allen Probes mission dataset, for use in setting up data-driven boundary conditions in a simulation. Specifcally, they add diffusion coefficients (and calculate their derivatives) for Upper Band and Lower Band Chorus waves (LBC and UBC) for the March 2013 geomagnetic storm and convert the coefficients into adiabatic invariant coordinates.

Due to the scientific nature and copyright, the datasets themselves and the simulation code cannot be shared.
